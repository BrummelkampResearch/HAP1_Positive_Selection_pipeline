## Output file from haploid enrichment screen analysis script analyze_enrichment.sh
##
## NM=number of mutations in positively selected populations of HAP1 cells, TNM=Total number of mutations in enriched population minus mutations in associated gene
## CT=number of mutations in non-selected control populations, TCT=Total number of mutations in control population minus mutations in associted gene
## Pv=Fisher exact P-value, FCPv=FDR Corrected P-value
## CCT=CT Corrected for zeros, TCTC=TCT Corrected (for zeros)
## TI=Total Insertions (NM+CCT), MI=mutation index (NM/TNM)/(CCT/TCTC)
## SEQ = optimal postiton of gene on x-axis when plotting the data as bubbleplot
