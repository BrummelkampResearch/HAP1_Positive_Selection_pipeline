# This scripts is for creating	#
# unique genenames in a gene-	#
# reference file based on chr.	#
# and strand.			#
# In rare more than one gene is #
# carries the same name but is  #
# location on different strands #
# or chromosomes. In those case #
# this script changes the name  #
# of that gene by concatenating #
# the chromosome number and	#
# strand to it.			#
